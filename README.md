# Introduction
Basal Metabolic Rate represents the number of calories one would burn in a day whether if they stayed in bed all day in every day of the week or whether they are active every day of the week. This application is a simple Flutter-based app which calculates a user's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) , this application also works out the user's daily calorie requirements. The app has both metric and imperial systems of measurements for better user accessibility. The app includes both the Harris-Benedict formula, along with the Mifflin - St Jeor formula, which superseded the Harrs-Benedict formula in 1990.
